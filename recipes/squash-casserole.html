            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch

                <li>Place squash, onion, and water in a large skillet over medium heat. Cover and cook until squash is

                    cooked squash mixture.</li>

                    and season with salt and pepper. Spread mixture into the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with remaining cracker mixture, and dot with 2 tablespoons butter.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top and set, about 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
