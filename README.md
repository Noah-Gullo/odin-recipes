## Description
My very first project in The Odin Project's Foundation curriculum. This project is a website that displays a few different meal recipes along with an image of the finished meal, a list of ingredients, and the steps in the recipe.

## Skills:
This project covers setting up a basic website with multiple webpages along with fundamental HTML elements such as links, images, unordered/ordered lists, and a few more. Also a useful introduction to GitHub pages combined with basic HTML. 

## Reflection:
This project provided a nice way of applying the HTML concepts and elements that I learned throughout The Odin Project's HTML Foundations. It was also useful to practice applying the basic Git commands and pushing to GitHub along with useful commit messages. Not the most challenging project, but it was definitely fun and I can't wait to style it with CSS later.
